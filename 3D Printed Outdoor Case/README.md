# 3d Printed Outdoor Case

Its kind of a work in progress

How it comes together:

1. print maincase, cablein (and mirrored) and top
2. get a peice of silicon for the top
3. in cablein, theres a place to glue in a piece of mesh
4. rap some silicon around the cable going into cable in for water-proofedness
5. waterproof the rest
6. glue it together (cablein has holes for 1.75m filimant to hold it together).
7. .....
8. PROFIT!!!

if you cant figure it out from that, then you can try but when i complete this work
i'll give some instructions with photos and a better explanation.
